CQRS Tic Tac Toe exercise with Axon
===================================

* A CQRS exercise for use in a CQRS workshop
* Uses Scala language (I really could not be bothered to do all the typing Java requires)
* Uses the [Axon Framework](http://www.axonframework.org/)
* Solution available in the 'solution' branch (e.g. `git diff master remotes/origin/solution`)

Instructions (IntelliJ)
-----------------------

* Install the scala plugin in IntelliJ
* Open the project in IntelliJ by selecting the pom.xml
* Find the TODO's and start fixing the compilation problems
* Use object TicTacToe as inspiration for how to use Board and sub types
* Try to run PlayTicTacToe
* Try to run the tests

Instructions (Eclipse)
----------------------
